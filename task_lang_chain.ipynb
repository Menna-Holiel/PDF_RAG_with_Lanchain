It highlights that monetary compensation (wages, salaries, tips, etc.) is a key factor impacting standard of living.  The data shows variations in median monthly income across different occupations, with computer and mathematical occupations, and architecture and engineering occupations having the highest, and personal care and service occupations having the lowest.  The report also notes differences in the rates of part-time work and overtime pay across various occupations, influencing income levels.  Finally, access to employer-provided health insurance also varied significantly by occupation, correlating with income levels.\n",

The percentages represent the proportion of the total employed population falling into each category, and the margin of error values indicate the uncertainty associated with these estimates.  The text notes that differences are significant at the 90 percent confidence level unless otherwise noted.\n",
